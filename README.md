# ✏️ TraceApp – Digital Lightbox for Touchscreens

**TraceApp** is a simple web-based tool that turns your tablet or touchscreen device into a digital lightbox. It locks the screen so you can place a sheet of paper over it and trace images without accidental movement. It also includes a grayscale mode to assist with sketching and shading references.

## 📱 How It Works

1. Open the site on your touchscreen device (tablet recommended).
2. Display your reference image or sketch layout.
3. Place a piece of paper over the screen.
4. Enable **Screen Lock** to prevent touch interference.
5. Toggle **Grayscale Mode** (optional) to simplify values for shading practice.
6. Trace the image directly through the paper using the backlit screen.

> 💡 Works best with thin paper and a bright screen.
